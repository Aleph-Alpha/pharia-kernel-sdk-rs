## Release

Releasing the Rust packages in this repository is automated with [release-plz](https://release-plz.ieni.dev/).

1. For every commit to the `main` branch, release-plz creates a release Pull Request.
2. Review the release Pull Request and add new changes if necessary.
3. Merge the release Pull Request and release-plz will release the updated packages.
